rosa's been stressed lately and her friend

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:10.000
about this cool meditation she's thinking about using it to find time to help him meditate

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:15.000
I know google didn't develop this app so if I share my google account data

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:20.000
what does it get access to get your basic profile information

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:25.000
which is your profile photo name and email address and if you choose you can share a dish

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:30.000
all kinds of data such as your contacts or as example demonstrates google cow

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:35.000
while google warns you about some apps that could be risky before you click

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:40.000
allow think about if you're comfortable sharing data with this app and what the app can

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:45.000
do with your data if you allow an app to view your day to be at may keep it

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:50.000
own copy of the data you've shared also be careful if an abscess

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:55.000
or manage your data because then the app can act independently

00:00:55.001 --> 00:01:00.000
change your google data like rescheduling or deleting events on your google calendar

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm comfortable sharing data with this app it's only asking to view my calendar data not right

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:10.000
which makes sense because all I wanted to do suggest meditation brakes around my schedule

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:20.000
that acted just what I needed it too but I'm done using it so why do

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:25.000
wanted to have access to anymore of my google data

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:30.000
could have copy the data you've already shared you can prevent it from accessing future data

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:35.000
signing into G dot co slash security check up then going to third

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:40.000
access to remove apps with access

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:45.000
getting the hang of windows share and remove access
